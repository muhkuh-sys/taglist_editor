<h2>CIP Sync support</h2>

<p>
This tag statically enables or disables support of the CIP TimeSync object and the underlying CIP Sync (IEEE1588) subsystem.

<table border=1>
<tr>
  <td>Enable CIP Sync</td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>checked: The CIP Timesync object will be created during firmware startup. <br>
      The host application can then dynamically register and unregister it through the packet API.</li>
      <li>unchecked: The CIP Timesync object and the CIP Sync subsystems will be statically disabled in the firmware. <br>
      This would allow for memory-constrained-platforms to assign more memory to other means.</li>
