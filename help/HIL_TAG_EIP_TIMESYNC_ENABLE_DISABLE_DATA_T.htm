<h2>CIP Sync support</h2>

This tag statically enables or disables support of the CIP TimeSync object and the underlying CIP Sync (IEEE1588) subsystem.

<table border=1>
<tr>
  <td>Enable CIP Sync</td>
	<td>The CIP Timesync object will be created during firmware startup. The host application can then dynamically disable and reenable it through the packet API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Disable CIP Sync</td>
	<td>The CIP Timesync object and the CIP Sync subsystems will be statically disabled in the firmware. This would allow for memory-constrained-platforms to assign more memory to other means.</td>
