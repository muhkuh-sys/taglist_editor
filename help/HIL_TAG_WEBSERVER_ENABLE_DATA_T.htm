<h2>Web server enable/disable</h2>

<p>
This parameter enables or disables the integrated web server.

<table border=1>
<tr>
  <td>Enable web server</td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>
        unchecked: Disabled <br>
        The web server is completely turned off (it is not initialized/started by the firmware) and therefore cannot be dynamically started (e.g. by the host application). <br>
        Use case: the web server is not needed by the product the firmware is integrated in. Disabling the web server saves memory that can be used for other purposes.
</li>
      <li>
        checked: Enabled  <br>
        The firmware will start/initialize the web server with the configuration provided by the following taglist entries: <br>
        Web Server (HTTP) Configuration<br>
        Web Server (HTTPS) Configuration
</li>
    </ul>
